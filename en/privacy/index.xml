“There is a sacred realm of privacy for every man and woman where he makes his choices and decisions — a realm of his own essen­tial rights and liber­ties into which the law, gener­ally speaking, must not intrude.”

What is KYC? # KYC or ‘Know your customer’ is a regulation that any businesses with a banking relationship has to abide by. Bitcoin exchanges are no different. These rules are imposed worldwide and are geared towards ensuring that a business acting as a money exchange and/or transmitter has ‘suitable’ information on every customer they serve.
Within the Bitcoin space, ‘creeping KYC’ is a disease that is slowly spreading.</description></item><item><title>Bitcoin Privacy</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/wiki-bitcoin-privacy/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/wiki-bitcoin-privacy/</guid><description>While Bitcoin can support strong privacy, many ways of using it are usually not very private.

&amp;ldquo;He is too great,&amp;rdquo; they all said, and the rooster of India, who had come into the world with spurs and believed himself to be emperor, inflated himself like a building all sails out, and walked straight on him in great fury and red to the eyes. The poor duck did not know whether to stop or walk: he was saddened to be scorned by all the ducks of the court.</description></item><item><title>CoinJoin Overview</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/privacy/coinjoin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/privacy/coinjoin/</guid><description>This article by @BitcoinOnly_ and @6102bitcoin was published on 6102bitcoin.com website.

Background # Bitcoin transactions are public by nature; they map inputs (unspent utxo’s) to outputs (new unspent utxo’s) in a way that is auditable by anyone with access to the bitcoin blockchain (the history of transactions). Yet interpreting these transactions and the Blockchain is a non-trivial task, because Bitcoin transaction are not equivalent to Bitcoin payments.

Okay, so basically it&amp;rsquo;s just my views as to the current state of Bitcoin fungibility. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to avoid any stream of consciousness stuff and get right to the point.
I’ll start off with playing a devil’s advocate. Perhaps, all of our problems with fungibility is our fault, maybe we dropped the ball and allowed Bitcoin to be defined as &amp;ldquo;money&amp;rdquo; by the state.</description></item></channel></rss>
