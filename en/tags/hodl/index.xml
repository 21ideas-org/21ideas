Intro # I would like to share a guide on Phoenix — the non-custodial Lightning wallet. This guide will be useful for those who already are familiar with the Lightning Network and have some experience using it. Let&amp;rsquo;s say you&amp;rsquo;ve already been using a custodial wallet like Wallet Of Satoshi and you want to gain more control over your funds, hold your sats in Lightning Network, and minimize the level of trust to a third party.</description></item><item><title>Electrum Bitcoin Wallet</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/electrum/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/electrum/</guid><description>This guide by Arman The Parman was published in his blog.

Why Electrum? # This is a detailed guide on how to use the Electrum Bitcoin Wallet, with solutions to all its traps and quirks -something I’ve developed after several years of use, and teaching students about Bitcoin security/privacy. Electrum is not the best Bitcoin wallet for the person who wants to keep everything as simple as possible, and preferring to remain at the beginner level.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Wallets</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/lightning-wallets/</guid><description>With repeated bumps of the popularity of monkey pictures in the Bitcoin blockchain and in anticipation of the upcoming bull market, fees in the mainnet don&amp;rsquo;t make anyone happy.
Fees in the network can reach hundreds of sats per virtual byte, and this is far from the limit. Source.
Lightning Network provides a solution to the painful problem of high fees, but you need to act thoughtfully, without hurrying. That&amp;rsquo;s why today I propose to analyze the best available Lightning wallets, evaluate the pros and cons of each of them, so that you can choose the best solution and finally forget (or at least minimize the stress) about high fees.</description></item><item><title>Installing Blue Wallet</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/blue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/blue/</guid><description>This guide by @econoalchemist was published in Bitcoin Magazine.

If you have an iPhone and have bitcoin, then I highly recommend using Blue Wallet to secure your BTC. This article will walk you through the basic steps for installing, securing and using Blue Wallet on iPhone. But, before getting started, it is a good idea to have a pen and paper ready. Remember to start with small amounts of bitcoin until these concepts make more sense and you are comfortable putting your funds in a mobile wallet.</description></item><item><title>SeedSigner: DIY Bitcoin Signing Device</title><link>https://21ideas.org/en/seedsigner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://21ideas.org/en/seedsigner/</guid><description>This comprehensive how-to guide walks you through unboxing, setting up and signing bitcoin transactions with the air-gapped SeedSigner device.
