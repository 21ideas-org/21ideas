If you could use tulips to instantly transmit value across the globe to anyone in any country, regard­less of whether they had a functioning govern­ment or banking system.

If the govern­ment couldn’t come to your door and take away your tulips or control who you could sell them to or in what ways.

If tulips could last for hundreds of years or millennia and be handed down to your children, redeemed for other forms of value.

If you could hide tulips in your brain and walk out of a failing nation holding all your wealth in your head without anyone being the wiser.

If you could program tulips to require autho­riza­tion from multiple parties before they could be passed on in a completely unbreakable way.

If it was impos­sible to grow inferior malnour­ished tulips by skimping on nutri­ents and selling them like the real deal.

If each tulip carried inscribed on its petals its entire unforge­able history of ownership.

If someone couldn’t invent a superior way to produce tulips and flood the market to crash the price.

Then yes, Bitcoin is just like Dutch tulip bubble.
